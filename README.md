# README Generator

## Description

This project was created to generate a high-quality, professional README.md file based on user input.
I built this project to ease the process of generating a new README.md file for each homework project and future project I am working on.
It solves the mundane task of creating each file from scratch.
I learned how to use node.js using the Inquirer package.
