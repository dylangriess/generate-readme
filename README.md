## Description

> My motivation for this project was to skip the process of making a new readme.md file for every project I am working on.
> I built this project to dynamically create a high-quality, professional style readme that could be presented to future projects automatically.
> It solves the hassle of creating a new readme from scratch, while potentially losing its quality.
> I learned how to use node.js with the inquirer package to take user input from provided prompts to make a markdown page.
